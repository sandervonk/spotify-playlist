# spotify-playlist
A lightweight playlist loader that should work on most sites! (just a little JS and CSS)

## How to:
Just add these 2 lines to your html page head, given that the two files are in the same folder as it:
```html
<script src="spotify-playlist.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="spotify-playlist.css"/>
```
